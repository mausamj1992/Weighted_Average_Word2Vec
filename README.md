--- Finding vector representations of graphs ---

Using vector representations of individual vertices of graphs, we calculate a single vector for the graph. First, we calculate degree of each vertex. Then we multiply the vectors of every vertex by their corresponding degree and sum all the resultant vector representations. Then we divide this vector by total sum of degrees of each vertex in the graph. This resulting vector represents the graph.
